In order to shoehorn conditionals into Python, the difference is small but important. Imagine this scenario as a better approximation of how *if* statements look in programming:\n","\n","> I leave the house through the front door every day. On days when the weather report calls for rain, then I'll grab my umbrella on the way out. In either case (rain or shine) I'm still leaving the house through the front door. It's just that sometimes I also grab an unbrella.\n","\n","In most computer programming languages, `if` statements are more like that. A behavior will always happen (I leave through the door). But ***IF*** a condition happens, I take a small detour. **But I still leave through that door!**\n","\n","Here's a graphical example. The Northville Placid Trail is a hiking trail that connects the towns of Northville, NY to Lake Placid, NY. If you were to walk the entire trail, you'd spend a few days hiking around 140 miles. But ***IF*** you were feeling especially ambitious, you could tack on an extra 22 miles doing the French Louis Trail. It's a small loop that starts and ends at the same spot on the Northville Placid Trail. In either case, you're still going from Northville to Placid; in one case you are adding on a little side quest.\n","\n","In both cases you are starting at the one point and ending at another.

I'd **like** to have a program where the user guesses a number and I can tell them if it is bigger than the number I'm thinking of, smaller than the number I'm thinking of, or equal to the number I'm thinking of. That is **three** different situations. Our current tool of `if else` does not allow for that; it can only have two different paths. An `if else-if else` statement allows for more than two outcomes.\n","\n","## `if elif else` Statements\n","\n","And now it is time for the `if elif else` framework. `elif` means \"ELSE IF\" and is used to help provide a deeper interrogation of a condition. One of the most popular examples that people can relate to is the notion of grades. For this demonstration, let's assume there is a course where you can earn an A, a B, a C, a D, or an F (there are no pluses or minuses). As humans, we are pretty good at identifying and sorting a small number of things just by looking at them - in fact, we can sorta-kinda do it better than computers on a small scale because computers have to examine the items one by one.\n","\n","So in this example, the schema for grades is:\n","\n","| NUMERICAL<br />GRADE | &nbsp; | LETTER<br />GRADE |\n","| :---                 | :---:  | :----:            |\n","| &nbsp;               | &nbsp; | &nbsp;            |\n","| 90 - 100             | &nbsp; | A                 |\n","| 80 - 89              | &nbsp; | B                 |\n","| 70 - 79              | &nbsp; | C                 |\n","| 65 - 69              | &nbsp; | D                 |\n","| 0 - 64               | &nbsp; | F                 |\n","\n","<br />\n","\n","So if the grade we are talking about is a 78, it is easy for us to file that as a \"C\" - we can look at the table and figure that out. Likewise, if the grade is something ridiculous, like a -45, we understand that it is not a valid grade. But here is the inner monologue of the computer doing the same task:\n","\n","> \"Gee, let's start at the beginning. I'm a computer so I can't look at a table and immediately figure out what the `grade` is when converted to a letter. The `grade` is 78. So let me see...\n","\n","> ***IF*** the `grade` is between 90 and 100, then the letter grade is an `A`.\n","\n","> ***ELSE IF*** `grade` is between 80 and 89, the letter grade is a `B`.\n","\n","> ***ELSE IF*** `grade` is between 70 and 79, the letter grade is a `C`. 🎉🎉🎉 YAY! This is it! `grade` matches to a `C`!!!\n","\n","\n","\n","<hr />\n","<font size=\"-1\">AUTHOR'S NOTE: Technically I just lied to you again a little bit. Humans are not faster than computers - we can't really multitask either. But we are pretty dang good at appearing as if we can multitask for small things. For instance, let's say I'm sorting playing cards that are all face up on a table and I'm putting them in either the pile of red cards or the pile of black cards. I can use both hands to pick up individual cards and put them in different piles. And though it may **seem** like both hands are simultaneously sorting cards, really my brain is telling my right hand where to sort the card it is currently holding. Once that command is sent, my brain tells the left hand what to do. But my right hand is still moving based off the last instruction from my brain, so it **appears** as if the hands are independent, but they are actually receiving instructions one at a time.</font>\n","<hr />\n","\n","<br />\n","\n","It is worth noting that you do not need an `else` statement in a block of `if elif`, but it's a good idea.
