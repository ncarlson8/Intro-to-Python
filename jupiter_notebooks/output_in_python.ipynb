Can you believe that? What a waste of paper! Like, every time we wanted to see the results of running software we would have to send the output to a printer, wait for the printer to print, and then look at the output.\n","\n","In fact, the popular computer game **The Oregon Trail** (you know, \"You died of dysentery\" fame) was played this way! The classroom had a *teletype* machine (kind of like a typewriter that was hooked up to a computer). You could type in input and the input would go to a computer in a closet somewhere and send the results back to the teletype. You can [read about the history of **The Oregon Trail** here](https://www.fastcompany.com/90702587/oregon-trail-computer-game-50th-anniversary). It's bonkers. In fact, the computer game predates the paper version of Dungeons and Dragons!\n","\n","Anyhow, the reason this is important is that you need to understand that in computer programming languages the term `print` still lingers. It's evolved over the years to mean \"print the output on the computer monitor instead of print on an actual printer\". So when you see the term `print` in most languages, it really means that the results will be displayed on the screen."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ArMGEdoZ4YLv"},"source":["## Different ways to use `print` in Python\n","\n","Check out the code below.

In the code below, we can see that there are single quotes in the `print` statement but there is an error in the code because of the apostrophe. Your job is to fix this so the code runs.

A *comment* is code that is not read by the computer. Using comments is handy for a few different reasons:\n","\n","1. **Creating an outline.** Whenever I sit down to write software, I *always* use comments and write down each step of the program. This is like an outline. Then, once I plan it out, I start adding actual code.\n","\n","2. **Add information right in your code**. When people read your code (or when you look at your code a week or a year from now) it is easy to get a feel for what the code does.\n","\n","3. **Attribution**. You should always put your own name, date, and description of the software in your code. I recommend doing that right at the top of the code. If you use code from somewhere else or you get help from, say, ChatGPT, you need to include that in comments in your code.\n","\n","4. ***Debugging***! If your code doesn't work as expected, but you don't know the exact line of code that is causing the error, you can \"comment out\" some lines of code - they won't run when the program runs. If you don't experience any issues, you can \"uncomment\" some of the lines that weren't run and see if those lines give you an error. If they do, then you know what is causing the problem.\n","\n","5. **\"TODO\" lists**. When I write code, I often use comments to make a list of things I want to do the program but haven't gotten around to yet.\n","\n","Here is some code with comments in it.
