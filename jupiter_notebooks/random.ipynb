We have to manually import the `random` module. Although it is authored by the Python people, you need to import it when working with random numbers. A *module* is a mini-program in a separate file that you can use in your own file. We use the command 'import random'.\n","\n","2. We can generate a random number using the command `random.random()`. There are actually a lot of different functions in the `random` module - we'll look at all of them in a bit.

And if the functionality you are testing (the player gets to go again!) is only triggered if you roll doubles, you might spend an awful long time trying to roll doubles just to test!\n","\n","\n","## Seeding\n","\n","Happily, software engineers have a trick up their sleeve. It's called *seeding* the random number generator. You see, this is how an random number generator works:\n","\n","1. Get a seed (if the programmer doesn't provide one, use the number of milliseconds that have elapsed from January 1, 1970 until now)\n","\n","2. Run that seed through an algorithm\n","    1. The algorithm is very complex - it's the [Mersenne Twister algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister) if you are interested - but let's just say that when you give the algorithm a seed then the algorithm will do the same complicated math each time and spit out an answer\n","\n","3. Enjoy the random number that has been generated\n","\n","So that means that in all the examples we've looked at so far, the *seed* for the random number generation was not provided by us; the computer knew (based on the clock) how many milliseconds have elapsed since the *Epoch* (January 1, 1970) and used **that** as the seed. That's actually pretty good for what we want to do most of the time - it's called a *psuedorandom number*, though, since we could predict the outcome. To generate a random number in Python, we need two things: a seed and an algorithm. We know the algorithm (Mersenne Twister), and we theoretically could know the seed (if we know what the current milliseconds are at the time we run the program). Note that the chances of actually doing this are infinitesimally small; it is near impossible to run the program at the exact instant you want to. So in general, a pseudorandom number is sufficient for most of the work we do.\n","\n","**NOTE: If you want to know how to truly generate a random number, there is information at the bottom of this reading that - if you read it - will impress your friends**\n","\n","So let's get back to this Monopoly problem.
