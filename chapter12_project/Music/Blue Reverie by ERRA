Silent wake as the day is burning
Slip back into my silhouette
I don't know when the trains are running
Get me back home to hide away, hide away, hide away
Sky ablaze in the subtle turning
Two-way motion in a pirouette
Wide awake with a quiet yearning
Get me seaside to hide away
Time waits for me in a blue reverie
Time waits for me in bloom
Do you imagine (do you imagine)
The illusion calls your name
From a world you can't embrace
Hide away
All the rain that's falling (all the rain that's falling)
That the clouds cannot contain
Until the embers find the waves
Hide away, hide away, hide away
Time waits for me in a blue reverie
Time waits for me in bloom
Hide away
Is wandering the cure
To the quiet annihilation?
A trilogy of decades gone
Knowing now that I'll always be searching
Silent wake as the day is burning
Slip back into my silhouette
I don't know when the trains are running
Get me back home to hide away
Hide away, hide away
Slip back into my silhouette
Hide away, hide away, hide away
Do you imagine (do you imagine)
The illusion calls your name
From a world you can't embrace
Hide away, hide away, hide away
