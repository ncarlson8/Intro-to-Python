Daylight fading, desolate skyline
Sun retreating giving way to dusk
Canvas sinking to darkness
Flickering are candles in the wind
Following behind the trail of the living to the feeding ground
All are one and the pulsing of a heart keeps an eternal bound
Open your veins
Open your veins
Hoоk up the line it's feeding time
Open the veins
Drink of the body
Blood like wine
Bow low, bow low
The children of the blood glow for the one eternal
Pray now, lest the darkness fall upon our rite
To the one eternal
Peering in the night
Servants
Everybody on the lane coddled in peace
The body had to cease
Soar below your sky
No wind below his dead wings
To the pale one, this life, we owe
Whispers trail in the breeze
Ignore the sound, though malicious it seems
Bow low, bow low
The children of the blood glow for the one eternal
Pray now, lest the darkness fall upon our rite
To the one eternal
Oh, the beauty abound
Bow low before the pale one
Pray now, lest the darkness fall upon our rite
To the one eternal
Interference howls in the dead of night
The dead of night
Remnants of an elden order circling hold tight
Our innocence betrays our safety
The reality of our destruction reaching for our sanity
Solidarity besieged
The remnants of an elden order servicing their vanity (vanity)
Weep as the darkness surrounds
Silent in the moonlight, as she goes
The air is stale as he lingers on his own
As he lingers on his own
Harboring the foresight with the teeth drawn
A commanding shadow pushes onward toward the throne
Draining borrowed blood and roaring loud as thunder
Nails tearing through the pale
The preservation of a life gone
Blood rains heavy in her trail
Mirrored image
The child of coddled demeanor
A family torn
Carry on by his side
Wide in the middle
Terrorize
The hunger showing teeth
Severing mortality
The hunger grows inside
Measuring a quarter in size
He moves swiftly into the night
So stay low, stay low
The fury of the stealth-blow
Drain the blood and the cries out to terrorize (see it in their eyes)
The pleasure of the hunt is recognized
Painting the town rose red beneath his feet
Red upon his face
For the taste, for the vengeance
Deemed the savior eternally
Painting the town rose red beneath his feet
Red upon his face
For the taste, for the vengeance
Deemed the savior eternally
Bow low, bow low
The children of the blood glow for the one eternal
Pray now, lest the darkness fall upon our rite
To the one eternal
Oh, the beauty abound
Bow low before the pale one
Pray now, lest the darkness fall upon our rite
To the one eternal
Servants
Everybody on the street living in peace
They rid it of disease
Open up your veins, hook up the line
Drink of the body
Blood like wine
Blood like wine
Open, open your veins
Drink of the body
Blood like wine
Son of darkness, feed in the dead of night
